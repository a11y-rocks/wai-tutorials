To help users orient themselves on web pages, the content and different areas need to be structured to help assistive technology identify them. This tutorial shows how to use HTML elements and WAI-ARIA attributes to allow users to navigate through the page and engage with the content efficiently.

* **[Page Sections](sections.html):** Identify and mark section on pages using HTML5 and WAI-ARIA `roles` to make sure that the purpose of each individual section is conveyed to users.

* **[Headings](headings.html):** Convey the page’s structure and sections of content by adding headings of different levels.

* **[Content Structure](content.html):** Mark up content so it can be easily interpreted and adapted to user’s needs.

* **[Styling](styling.html):** Apply a distinct hierarchy to the visual page’s design, so users are able to easily determine what each section of the page does.

* **[In-page Navigation](in-page-navigation.html):** Provide navigation aids to help users to get around the page and discover the various sections of the page. Consider adding a “table of content” for longer pieces of content.

## Why is this important?

The content of the page is the reason people are visiting websites in the first place. Being unable to find content or navigate inside individual pages can create major accessibility barriers. An accessible page structure benefits users in many situations such as:

* **People using screen readers** can skip to the content directly and navigate to sections that are important to them. Content is read out in the way it is intended.
* **People using distraction-free reading plugins** will receive better results if the main content is easily to determine.
* **People using certain browser plugins** can use landmark roles to jump to specific sections on a page.
* **Keyboard users** can save the time and trouble to navigate through a number of links using the tab key.
* **Search engines** can use the data to make better predictions on the real content of a web page.
